# Question
Using `async`/`await` over `.then`/`.catch` makes our code for handling promises much more readable. What are the ways in which `async`/`await` is more readable than `.then` and `.catch`?

# Answer
To start off, the "async" label in a function tells us that whatever function it labels is not syncronous, and thus means we have to pay special attention to what it needs to happen for it to run. "Await" is the key word which tells us what the function's cue is to run. Because of the way these two promise functions work, JS won't run the function inside of a function labeled "async" until the "await" promise/fetch comes back successful (the fetch promise settles). then/catch however, **runs the function but won't execute the then()** until the promise settles. 

Async/await saves a lot of time by not going through a full function without a guarantee that it has what it needs to execute its task successfully. We know much quicker when something goes wrong. Then/catch not only waste a lot of time by prioritizing the function over the resources needed for it to successfully run by making the fetch lesser prioritized than the function it's supporting, but you have to write what you want to do with the fetch promise **after** the fetch in the .then() chain. It's more code to run, and thus more time.
