# Question

This code snippet makes a fetch to get the first todo item from the JSON placeholder API. Or at least it tries to.

What is wrong with this code? 

Describe how async/await helps us avoid this mistake.

```js
fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')
  .then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Fetch failed!');
    response.json();
  })
  .then(json => console.log(json))
  .catch(err => console.log(err))
```

You can run this code of course, but try not to! Try to figure out the issue on your own.

# Answer
The first then() function doesn't return anything. then() doesn't implicitly return values, thus the function would've immediately thrown an error since there was nothing to console log. Using Async/await would remove the need to chain so many then statements, and condense the code into a simple, constructive and flowing function by asking the function to try fetching data from the link, await the fetch to be fulfilled, then await the data to be converted from JSON before doing anything with it. If anything goes wrong, you can just catch the error right off the bat instead of waiting for a then() chained promise to go awry.
